Understanding Diabetes with Data Science
We currently live in the world of big data; the abundance of data has strengthened the use of data-oriented research in healthcare and public health. One of the major advantages and uses of big data in healthcare is diagnosing and developing prognoses for life threatening and life debilitating diseases. An example of such disease is diabetes. There are three main types of diabetes. Type 1 DM results when an individual’s body fails to produce insulin and requires artificial insulin day in and day out; this is a chronic, incurable autoimmune disease. Type 2 DM results from insulin resistance; with this condition an individual’s cells fail to use insulin properly. The third main form is gestational diabetes. As the name implies, this condition occurs during pregnancy and causes pregnant woman to develop high blood glucose levels without a prior diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetes is an important health problem and early screening of the disease can have significant health benefits. The rate of morbidity can be reduced or prevented with early medication and/or lifestyle changes. The main goal of this project is to use data science to determine the most common comorbidities associated with prediabetes and diabetes, such as hypertension, overweight/obese based on BMI, age and high cholesterol.
